Explain what you believe is happenning in 100 words or less

In the counter example, a button component is being created with an event handler. When the button is clicked the event, handler updates the state of count. Since state is tied to the button when you create a new instance of the button the count is separate and each button has its own separate counter. If we apply the hook to the app then anytime the button is pressed either the first or second they are tied to the same count so they will have the same use state.
