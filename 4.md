# Big-O Notation

1. What is Big O Notation? 

Big-O us to analyze our functions to understand how much space and time it takes to scale our functions. 

In the words of Ned Batchelder " How your code slows as your data grows".

2. Contrast Big O with Omega and Theta. 

Omeaga is the best possible result we can expect at runtime. The average result can be expressed as Theta. The worst case scenario or the expected scenario is expressed in Big-O notation.


3. Show 1 Code Example Each Of Linear Time Complexity and Quadratic Time Complexity.

Linear Time Complexity is O(N) 
    
    const data = ['A','B','C']

    for(let i = 0 ; 0 < data.length ; i ++){
        console.log(data[i])
    }

Quadratric Complexity O(N^2)

    const data = [1,2,3,4,5]

    for(let i = 0 ; 0 < data.length ; i++){
        for(let j= 0 ; 0 < data.length ; j++){
            console.log(data[i], data[j])
        }
    }
