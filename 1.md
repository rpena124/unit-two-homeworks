### **How Does The Internet Work ?**

The internet has enabled us to be able to connect computers all over the world through one network! It allows us to host a site on a server and when someone one makes a call to that address the server gets the request and send the documents to the client. The clients browser or local server then converst the document into what you end up seeing in and interacting with in the browser.

### **What do HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do?**

HTML which stands for Hypertext Markup Languague is the document format used for the webpages. Its the foundation or the strucuture of your "house". It allows you to all various elements like header, paragraphs, phots, videos, forms, you name it. But with just HTML your house are just blank walls, you want to add color, material, textures, funriture... thats where CSS comes in. 

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet, and this is wehre you style your page or decorate your home. But your home would be pretty boring if you could not do some activities, so get a pool, add some solar panels, put a gym or adding anything thats mechanical that interacts with the tenent is like your Javascript. Javascript allowd your site to interact with the visitors, adding event listeners to make the page respond by clicking or rendering information on the screen based on the choices a user makes is all controlled by Javascript. 

### **What is the difference between backend and frontend?** 

The backend controls the achitecture of the system. This is where you create your servers, create your API's, data bases, and methods that recieve request from the front end to consumers who then have to retrieve the information in the database or API etc. All this is done behind the scences without the client ever reazling what is happeing under the hood. 

The frontend on the other hand is everything the client sees on a site or application. This is all your HTML, CSS and Javascript.
